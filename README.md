# Binary-and-RedBlack-Trees
Various classes which try creating the Binary tree and RedBlack Tree data structures.

As of now, only `TreeGraphics.java` is the only functional, fully working class.

`BinarySearcTreeDriver` and `BinaryCardTreeDriver` work partially, while `RedBlackTreeDriver` is in progress

Rest are object classes used in these driver classes.
